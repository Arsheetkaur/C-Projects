## Project 3 - Terminal-Based Digital Clock

This project is a terminal-based digital clock written in C. It displays the current *time and date, updating every second. The user can choose between **12-hour* and *24-hour* time formats.

### Features

- Live digital clock updates every second
- Displays full current date (e.g., Thursday May 08 2025)
- Supports both 12-hour and 24-hour formats
- Cross-platform screen clearing (Windows and Unix-based)
- Simple terminal interface

### How It Works

- The user is prompted at launch to select a time format.
- The program enters an infinite loop, updating time and date every second.
- The screen is cleared and updated each second to simulate a digital clock.
